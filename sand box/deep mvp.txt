Here's a comprehensive MVP design for a cloud-based cash register system with database integration, API, and frontend app:

Core Architecture Components
Backend API (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI)

Database (PostgreSQL or Firestore)

Frontend App (React Native/Flutter for mobile, React for web)

Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP or Firebase)

Database Schema (PostgreSQL Example)
sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL -- 'cashier', 'manager'
);

CREATE TABLE registers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE shifts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  register_id INTEGER REFERENCES registers(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  open_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  close_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  initial_balance NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  final_balance NUMERIC(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  shift_id INTEGER REFERENCES shifts(id) NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (type IN ('entry', 'outtake', 'tip')) NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  note TEXT
);
API Endpoints (RESTful Design)
Authentication

POST /auth/login - JWT token generation

POST /auth/refresh - Token refresh

Shift Management

POST /shifts/open - Open register

POST /shifts/{id}/close - Close register

GET /shifts/active - Get active shift

Transaction Operations

POST /transactions - Add transaction

GET /shifts/{id}/transactions - List shift transactions

Reporting

GET /shifts/{id}/report - Generate shift report

GET /registers/{id}/history - Historical reports

Frontend App Features
Authentication Flow

Login with role-based access

Session management

Register Operations

Open/close register view

Real-time balance display

Transaction entry forms

Digital receipt generation

Management Dashboard

Multi-location register status

Shift history with filtering

End-of-day reconciliation

Cash flow analytics

Admin Panel

User management

Register configuration

Access controls

Cloud Infrastructure (AWS Example)
text
1. Application Layer:
   - EC2 instances (or Lambda) for backend
   - CloudFront CDN for frontend

2. Data Layer:
   - RDS PostgreSQL
   - ElastiCache for sessions

3. Services:
   - Cognito for authentication
   - S3 for report storage
   - CloudWatch for monitoring

4. Security:
   - VPC with private subnets
   - SSL termination at ALB
   - KMS for encryption
Key Workflows
Opening Register

Cashier logs in → Selects register → Enters starting cash → System creates shift record

Transaction Processing

User selects transaction type → Enters amount → Optional note → System validates/store in DB → Updates real-time balance

Closing Shift

System calculates final balance → Generates discrepancy report → Manager approval → PDF report generation

Reconciliation

Daily/weekly financial reports

Cash variance analysis

Audit trail for all transactions

Security Considerations
Data Protection

End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3)

PII masking

Database encryption at rest

Access Control

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

JWT expiration (15-30 mins)

IP allowlisting for admin functions

Compliance

PCI-DSS for payment handling

GDPR for European users

Audit logs for all operations

MVP Feature Prioritization
Phase 1 (Core)

Register open/close

Transaction recording

Basic shift reporting

Single-store support

Phase 2 (Extended)

Multi-location support

Digital receipts

Basic inventory linking

Manager approvals

Phase 3 (Advanced)

Payment integration (Stripe/Square)

Tax calculation

Employee performance metrics

Predictive cash forecasting

Technical Validation Points
Performance

Handle 100+ transactions/minute

<2s API response time

Offline capability (local storage sync)

Reliability

99.9% uptime SLA

Automated backups

Transaction rollback recovery

Scalability

Auto-scaling backend

Read replicas for DB

Caching layer for reports

This MVP design provides a foundation for a secure, scalable cash management system that can evolve from a single-store solution to an enterprise platform. The architecture prioritizes auditability, ease of use, and compliance while maintaining flexibility for future expansion.
